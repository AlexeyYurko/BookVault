# BookVault

## Introduction

BookVault is a simple tool for managing your books. 
It's created mostly for my own use, but it's also open source and can be used by anyone.

General purpose of BookVault is to store your books in a central local location, tag them, search them, and do not pass 
duplicate books to your library.

## Tooling

(as simple as possible)
- Python3.12
- ~~Flask~~ FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
